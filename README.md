# signatum.miner
Optimizations on the official AMD miner from signatum.io

Test on rx 480 4G/8G and RX 460 4G

Average gain time is about 5% from the official miner.

<b>INSTALLation</b>
Just unzip the package over where sgminer.exe reside and <B>delete all .BIN </b> files.

For the suspicious ones, I did not recompiled the projects, just worked on the kernels.
So you can verify that the md5 from this packages are identical from the one on signatum.io

I did this so everybody enjoy a little upgrade in MHS for the little time left to mine signatum.

Enjoy !
